# 1. Overview

SwimSafer was an initiative by the National Water Safety Council in collaboration with Sport Singapore (“SportSG”, formerly known as Singapore Sports Council) in 2010. The Programme was reviewed in 2016-2017 and a refreshed version of SwimSafer was developed. SwimSafer 2.0 teaches people of all ages and varying abilities to swim and be safe in, and/or, around water. The programme emphasises skill development in conjunction with water safety and personal water survival education.

The Programme consists of six (6) progressive stages, with each stage consisting of two (2) components that must be completed to be considered as cleared/competent for the respective stage:

- A practical assessment (100% competent)
- An online theory quiz (90% passing)

The SwimSafer Centralized Assessment Management System (CAMS) is a national initiative designed to enhance the quality and experience of SwimSafer assessments, including streamlining processes, standardizing operations, improving accessibility and transparency, and ensuring consistency for parents, participants, instructors and swim schools.

# 2. General

# 2.1 CAMS Assessment Portal

The SwimSafer CAMS assessment platform (CAMS Platform) is designed to support the administration and implementation of SwimSafer CAMS assessments, and is accessible to all stakeholders, including participants, coaches, parents, assessors and swim schools.

For guidance on how to navigate the CAMS Platform, please refer to the CAMS Platform User Guide available at https://www.sgaquatics.org.sg/swimsafer/

# 2.2 Registration on CAMS Platform

It is the responsibility of all coaches and swim schools to ensure that you and your participants have registered on the CAMS Platform.

Participants not registered on the CAMS Platform will not be able to register or be registered for any SwimSafer assessments.

ANNEX E - Frequently Asked Questions

# Assessment Centres

1. Can I request for an assessment slot at the centralised assessment centres outside of the operating hours for CAMS?
- No. The operating hours for CAMS at the centralised assessment centres are fixed and requests for separate individual assessments outside these hours will not be permitted.

- No, SwimSafer is designed to prepare participants to be water safe in any environment. We encourage you to speak with your coach to ensure your child’s readiness for the assessment.

# Practical Assessments

I did not tag my child/myself to my coach or club on the CAMS Platform. Will I still be able to register for an assessment?
- You will need to ensure that you are tagged to your coach on the CAMS Platform before you can register for an assessment. It is not mandatory for you to tag yourself to a club in order to register. However, do note that if you do not tag yourself to your club, your club administrator will not be able to administer any assessments on your behalf.

What should I do if I am unable to find my coach on the CAMS Platform to tag myself to?
- Only SwimSafer certified instructors are able to have access to the CAMS Platform as a coach. Please check with your coach to ensure he/she has registered themselves onto the CAMS Platform.

I have completed payment for an assessment, and would like to cancel. Can I get a refund?
- No refunds will be provided once you have registered for an assessment. If you are unable to attend your scheduled assessment, you should reschedule your assessment before the registration closing deadline of three (3) weeks before the scheduled assessment date. After the registration closing deadline, no rescheduling of assessments will be permitted. Please confirm your availability for the assessment before making payment.

# 7. Can I change my child’s assessment stage after payment?
